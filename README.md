# My Portfolio

This is my last frontend creation made with Next.js.
Simply said : this is my official portfolio/website.
A chose a simple design with dark futuristic vibes.

## Features :

- homepage with some animations, my intro and skills
- portfolio page, with most of my creations
- contact page, with a contact form (calling a personnal API) and my medias link
- abusing the simplicity of flexbox for full responsiveness
- using Next.js features for better SEO
- some tests with the Image feature for better optimization and shorter loading time
- Type package for some nice animations.
